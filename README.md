# Tic Tak Toe 
Welcome to the well known universal game of Tic Tak Toe! (or noughts and cross depending on your preference...)
As we all know Tic Tak Toe is one of the most common and well known games around the world, so it only felt natural to want to build one as part of my [Code Insitute Secondary Project.](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/)

## Project Goals

Having just done the walkthrough project of Love Maths within my studies at Code Institue, I found myself enjoying the idea of playing against a computer, with the possibilities of anything randomly happening wihtin the game itself. I therefore went with Tic Tak Toe (I also love that it's the game that bests the machine in War Games the movie.)

### User Goals
- Ease of use, with INSTANT recogntion of what the game was.
- If the user has never encounterered this game before, I wanted the rules/ instructions to be available to them straight off the bat.
- Create a username, linked to the scoreboard for added personalisation, potentially for the hope of returning use.
- Make sure children can use the site/game without supervision/ guidance.

## Features 

## Design 
My version of Tic Tak Toe is based around children of ages 4+ being able to enjoy this game. 

### Wireframes
I wanted to have the Title front and foremost in the center, so people are drawn to the center of the page.
I realised early on that I wanted the grid to be the first thing you see. Which meant building the rest of my ideas around the center of the page. Hence the 'Replay' being at the top of the grid and the 'Start Over' button underneath the scoreboard.

I wanted the phone design to correspond with the laptop design, luckily because of the lack of clutter on the screen and centeral placement of most features it was easy to modify.

### Colour Scheme 
I recently found a teen book that gave me inspriation for this game's main colour scheme. Most of my prospective users are going to be 4+ I figured using bright colours with sharp white contract would be inviting for young children. 
I used [My Color Space ](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23EA0661&sub=1) to get the Hex code I wanted, and went from there.
