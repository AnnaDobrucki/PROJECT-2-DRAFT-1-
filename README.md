# Tic Tak Toe 
Welcome to the well known universal game of Tic Tak Toe! (or noughts and cross depending on your preference...)
As we all know Tic Tak Toe is one of the most common and well known games around the world, so it only felt natural to want to build one as part of my [Code Insitute Secondary Project.](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/)

## Project Goals

Having just done the walkthrough project of Love Maths within my studies at Code Institue, I found myself enjoying the idea of playing against a computer, with the possibilities of anything randomly happening wihtin the game itself. I therefore went with Tic Tak Toe (I also love that it's the game that bests the machine in War Games the movie.)

### User Goals
- Ease of use, with INSTANT recogntion of what the game was.
- If the user has never encounterered this game before, I wanted the rules/ instructions to be available to them straight off the bat.
- Create a username, linked to the scoreboard for added personalisation, potentially for the hope of returning use.
- Make sure children can use this without supervision/ guidance.
